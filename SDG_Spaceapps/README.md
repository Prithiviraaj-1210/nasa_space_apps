# SDG for Classroom

## Overview

The **SDG for Classroom** project aims to educate students about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and promote environmental awareness through an interactive web-based platform. The key feature of the platform is a **Personalized Carbon Footprint Calculator** that allows users to estimate their individual environmental impact and take actionable steps toward sustainability.

This project is developed as part of a NASA event and is built using **Streamlit**, offering a simple, intuitive interface for users to engage with sustainability concepts.

## Features

- **Personalized Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Users can input their daily habits (transportation, energy consumption, waste generation, etc.) to calculate their carbon footprint. The results are presented in real-time, offering personalized insights.
  
- **Educational Content**: Along with the calculator, the platform provides educational modules on the SDGs, particularly focusing on environmental sustainability. The content helps users understand how their actions impact global goals.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is built using Streamlit, ensuring a clean, easy-to-navigate UI that allows users to access the app from any web browser without additional setup.

- **Actionable Suggestions**: Based on the carbon footprint results, users receive tips and suggestions on how to reduce their environmental impact, fostering a sense of responsibility and engagement with sustainability.
